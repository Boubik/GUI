# Search Graf

A program that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph and visualizes it using JavaFX technology is a tool for graph visualization and analysis. The program allows loading the graph structure from an input CSV file, where vertices, edges, and their weights are defined.

During the computation, the algorithm traverses the edges of the graph and assigns temporary distance values to the vertices from the starting vertex. Based on these values, the algorithm selects the nearest unvisited vertex and updates the temporary distance values for adjacent vertices.

After the computation is complete, the program displays the shortest path between the selected vertices in the form of a graphical output in JavaFX. This allows users to visually observe the discovered path and analyze the distances between vertices.

This program combines Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with the use of JavaFX for graph visualization and algorithm results. It is a useful tool for studying and analyzing graphs, enabling users to easily explore and understand their structure and distances between individual vertices.
